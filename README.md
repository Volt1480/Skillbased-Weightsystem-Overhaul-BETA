# Skillbased-Weightsystem-Overhaul-BETA

⚠️ Important Notice⚠️

Due to major internal changes in Project Zomboid Build 42, some parts of Weight Overhaul may currently behave incorrectly.
These issues are caused by engine-side engine changes, not by your setup or other mods.
A compatibility update is actively in development.

For multiplayer servers:⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️
AntiCheat Type 2 (SpeedHack) must be disabled for the mod to work correctly.

QOL Weight System Overhaul

A skill-based weight system for Project Zomboid.
The more skilled your character becomes, the lighter items feel — improving carry capacity, movement, and overall survivability in a natural, progression-based way.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skill scaling:

Skill levels 1–5 reduce item weight by 4% per level

Skill levels 6–10 reduce item weight by 5% per level

This means a high-level character can carry and handle materials far more efficiently, without using artificial buffs or consumables.

The mod is still in development — feedback and suggestions are very welcome.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compatibility

Works with existing savegames

Supports Build 41.78 and Build 42.x

Singleplayer & Multiplayer compatible

Client-side only (no item or recipe replacements)

Safe to use with:

modded inventories

custom containers

Large modpacks and servers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Container Behavior (Known Limitation)⚠️⚠️

Weight scaling applies only while items are in the player’s inventory.
Items in crates, vehicles, bags, or on the ground will temporarily show their vanilla weight.

This is a technical limitation of the game and does not affect balance or item safety.
A UI-side fix for this behavior is currently in development.
